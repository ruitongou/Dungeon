# Dungeon Challenge
### Background
You are a brave adventurer going into a dungeon with a big treasure at the deepest level.  
This dungeon has attracted a lot of adventurers, but no one has gotten the treasure yet.  
You heard a ferocious Dragon is guarding the treasure, you must go through all the levels and defeat it. 
### Game logic
You will start with a maximum of 100 health points, 5 coins, an iron sword, and an iron armor.  
You will lose 2 health points for every level you complete.  
You can find weapons, armor, items (health potions, magic scrolls), and coins in treasure chests.  
You can also meet a merchant who will sell you items.  
You may encounter some monsters on some levels, defeating them will give you loot (item or coins).  
You can use health potions to recover 20 health points, or magic scrolls to automatically defeat monsters instantly (without loot).
### Suggestions

Remember to check your status in the command, and use your items and coins wisely.  
Since all events are randomly generated, the game depends a lot on your luck!
